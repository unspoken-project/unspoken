# Unspoken Grading Notes

- I added a background color to your body so that the app blends a little better on a large screen
- I love your color scheme - that yellow is chef's kiss
- Make sure you add some info to the README about the project and yourselves
- Removed some points for tests that are skipped as well as missing tests on the presentational components -- in general, try to write those tests at the same time as you're building the components
- Overall the app looks great -- code is clean and easy to follow
