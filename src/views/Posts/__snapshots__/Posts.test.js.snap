          more like, what I can do. You've changed my life. I know you might not want all the credit, but I wouldn't have gotten this far without you. You were the key to the start of the rest of my life. And I look forward to seeing you throughout the future.

          to echo what michelle said, learning this new technical, abstract, challenging stuff from someone who isn't a man was a powerful experience for me, too. you made me believe i could learn it. you really believed in me when i didn't believe in myself. without your encouragement and vote of confidence i don't know if i would have made it this far. you're a fantastic teacher, not only do you have extensive knowledge, you're also able to relay it in a way that makes sense to those of us with no experience. that is something many smart people lack. your emotional intelligence mirrors your technical skill, and that is a rarity in the professional world. you're a GEM! thank you for ushering us into the next chapter of our lives with grace, patience, humor, and empathy! can't thank you enough. marty! give this rock star a RAISE!!!!!!!

          I was worried about going into tech; the biases from others, the difficult questions they'd ask me, the internal conflicts. But being taught by Julie was the best introduction into this world I could have asked for. I saw how intelligent, powerful and graceful she is, and it inspired me to be as such. Im sure Julie has some stories too to have gotten to where she is now, and I hope she knows that she has become a part of mine.

          Thank you ALL for providing such an amazing introduction to coding for me. It's been truly a one-of-a-kind experience and a time I will never forget. I've grown so much in these past 4 months technically / mentally speaking and it's all {props} to each one of you. Don't forget to visit Portland! p.s. this app is amazing.

          In the words of one of my favorite authors, "Be prepared to struggle, both intellectually and creatively. The truth is, I don't know of any human activity as demanding of one's imagination, intuition and ingenuity. But I do it anyway. I do it because I love it and because I can't help it. Once you've been to the jungle, you can never really leave. It haunts your waking dreams."

Thank you Julie for helping me in my struggle! You are an inspiration and a role model. It's nice to see you had such an impact on the September cohort, I know you did on mine as well.
